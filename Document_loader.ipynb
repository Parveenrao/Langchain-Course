            "\n",
            "1. **Objective/Summary Statement:** Consider adding a concise objective or summary statement at the beginning of your resume to provide a clear and compelling overview of your career goals and aspirations. This will help recruiters quickly understand your value proposition.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Quantifying Accomplishments:** When describing your work experience and projects, strive to quantify your accomplishments whenever possible. This will provide tangible evidence of your impact and make your resume more impressive. For instance, instead of saying \"Improved prediction accuracy,\" you could say \"Improved prediction accuracy of heart rate anomalies by 15% through the implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Highlighting Skills:** While you have listed your technical skills, consider organizing them into relevant categories such as programming languages, data science libraries, and database management. This will make it easier for recruiters to scan and identify your key proficiencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Using Action Verbs:** Use strong action verbs throughout your resume to describe your responsibilities and accomplishments. This will convey a sense of proactivity and impact. For example, instead of saying \"Conducted an in-depth study,\" you could say \"Led an in-depth study.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Proofreading:** Carefully proofread your resume for any grammatical errors or typos. A polished and error-free resume will create a professional impression.\n",
